# CleanDataSmartPhone

This is the tidy data of the activity readings from an experiment conducted.
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================
aggTidyReading.txt -  Tidy Data of Activity experiment.

CookBook.md - Cook Book describing the columns of the data above.

README.md - General description of project and files.

run_analysis.R - R script executing the extraction and transformation of raw data into tidy data.
